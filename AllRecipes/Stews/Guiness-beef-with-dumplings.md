# Guinness Beef Stew with Dumplings

Stolen shamelessly from reddit, with tweaks to fix glaring issues.

# Ingredients List

Stew:

- 1/4 pound bacon
- 2 pounds boneless beef chuck, chopped into bite-sized pieces
    - Don't buy the good stuff here. Cheapest cut possible. You're cooking this thing for so long that you'll make the toughest piece of meat tender.
- 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon of onion powder
- 4 sticks celery, chopped
- 3 large carrots, chopped
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large potatoes or parsnips, diced
- 3 ounces tomato paste
- 1 (12 ounce) bottle Guinness
- 4 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed
- 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced (optional)
- Chopped parsley

Cheddar Herb Dumplings:

- 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/3 cup shortening
- 3/4 cup shredded Irish sharp cheddar
- 2/3 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons mixed fresh herbs such as parsley, chives, and thyme, chopped

# Instructions 
## Stew
- Cook the bacon in a large, oven-safe, heavy-based pot or high-walled saute pan over medium heat.
- Remove the bacon, crumble, and set aside, but leave the bacon fat in the pot. 
- Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper in a large bowl. 
- Cut the beef into inch cubes, and add to the flour mixture. Toss the beef until it is coated.
- Cook the beef in the pot. You'll want to create a single layer of beef, and flip the beef once the edges of the beef start to go pale. The goal is to create a crust, not fully cook the beef. Set the beef aside.
- In the same pot, fry the onion, celery, and carrots until soft and fragrant, adding a little grapeseed oil if necessary. You can also use butter here, but you should have a bit of bacon fat left to cook this.
- Add garlic and fry for another 30 seconds. Stir in the tomato paste.
- Pour in the Guinness and Worcestershire sauce. Allow to come to a simmer and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. 
    - A note about the beer: I usually lean towards more is better here. Just take off from the amount of broth you add.
- Add the beef back to the pot and pour in the chicken broth. Add the bay leaf and thyme. 
- Reduce to a simmer and cover. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes. Simmer for another 1/2 hour, or until the vegetables are tender.
    - A test to see if this has cooked long enough is the beef should be a bit softer now. You're shooting for being able to break apart the strands by squeezing it between your fingers.
    - Potatoes are done when you can easily put a fork through the tater.
- Remove the bay leaf and thyme branches. If the stew is still thin, mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water to form a slurry. Mix the slurry into the stew and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer again, stirring occasionally, and add in the mushrooms if desired. Cook for 10 minutes, uncovered, until the stew thickens and the mushrooms are cooked through. 
- Stir the bacon back in. I can't tell you how many times I forgot about it.

## Dumplings
- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
- Stir together the self-rising flour and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Cut in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
- Stir in the cheddar cheese, then add the milk and stir until the dry ingredients are moistened.
    - This mix should be a bit sticky. If it's still crumbly, add more milk.
- Make small balls with the dough and place them on top of the stew, leaving them room to expand– they grow a lot as they cook. Place the stew in the oven uncovered and bake until the dumplings are browned and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes.
- Garnish the stew with parsley and serve.
