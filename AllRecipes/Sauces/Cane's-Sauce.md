# Cane's Sauce
This is about as close as you'll get to it without going in. Goes good on burgers, fries, tendies, and whatever else you can dip.

# Ingredients
- 150g Duke's Mayo (They use extra heavy mayo, but man duke's is good)
- 100g Ketchup (I use Whataburger's spicy ketchup)
- 16g Worcestershire Sauce 
- 1/2 tsp. Lemon Pepper
- 1/2 tsp. Garlic Salt
- 1/2 tsp. MSG

## Extras
- To get an even more "aoili" feel, cook off bacon. From a height, incorporate to half a container of Duke's mayo. You need it cool enough to not separate the mayo, but warm enough to incorporate, so dripping it from on high out of the pan is generally good enough. Whisk this together. You'll basically want equal parts mayo to bacon fat. No, we're not going for healthy here. That fancy aoili you ask for at a restaurant? This is what it is.

# Instructions
Put'em in a bowl and whisk together. Let chill for half a day, serve. 

# TODO:
Figure out porportions on a spicy version. This will involve most likely chili oil, but we'll find out.
