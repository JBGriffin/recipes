# Smoked Queso

Easy queso recipe that always hits

# Ingredients List
- 1 lb Breakfast Sausage (Spicy or not)
- 1/2 diced onion
- 1/2 cup of cilantro
- 10 oz can of Rotel (baby can)
- 32 oz H-E-B Easy Melt (Velveta in a pinch)
- 4 oz cream cheese
- Taco seasoning
- 1/2 can of beer

# Instructions
- Brown breakfast sausage in a pan
- Add taco seasoning and prep how you normally would. If possible, use half the seasoning. The goal is to reduce the SALT you're adding here. The cheese will be plenty salty, so you really don't want to add more
- Move the sausage to a large baking container. If there is extra liquid, do not bring it over. All items you put into the container will want to be separated for now. This will help spread the smoke flavor later.
- Cube the cheeses and add to the container, along with the onion, cilantro, and beer. Drain the can of rotel and add as well. 
- Get the smoker to a steady 275&deg;F and cook for 45 minutes
- After 45 minutes, stir the contents. Cook for another 45 minutes. If it's still thin, you can cook it longer.
