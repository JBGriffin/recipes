# Pork Butt
I don't know if there's difficulty levels for BBQ, but pork butt is definitely pretty easy. Don't need to do much with it.

# Ingredients List

- Pork shoulder, bone in
- 1 cup pickling salt
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup MSG
- Sriracha 
- Spices
  - Pink sea salt (or kosher salt)
  - Black Pepper
  - Garlic powder
  - Paprika

# Odds and Ends
- Large container for the brine. I use a 12 QT container
- Wisk
- Old shaker bottle for seasoning
- Nitrile Gloves
- Fish fillet knife, or a really sharp knife
- Smoker
- Bake safe bowl

# Instructions

- Trim down the fat to cap to desired level on the pork butt. I don't mess with it too much. I'll take off about an 1/8th to 1/4 of an inch

## Brine
- Add the pickling salt, brown sugar, and MSG to your large container. Fill it with water to about 4 QTs. Wisk it all together. 
    - Because of the pickling salt, we don't need to heat the water to super saturate with the salt. 
- Put the pork butt into the container, and fill with water until it's fully submerged. Add something heavy to keep it at the bottom if need be. Let it brine between 12 and 18 hours. I usually go with 12 since I smoke it in the morning. 

## Seasoning 
- This is going to be a ratios game. It's easier to do this in batches and just keep it in an old spice container. But this is what I'll shoot for:
    - 1/2 cup black pepper
    - 1/4 cup kosher salt
    - 1/4 cup garlic powder
    - 1/8 cup paprika (this is mostly for color and can be left off if you don't want to add)
- Wisk the seasoning together and add it to a shaker bottle
- Take the pork butt from the brine and pat dry as well as you can
- Rub sriracha on all of the surface of the pork butt
    - Sriracha will be the binder for your seasoning. This isn't exactly necessary, but I feel like it gives a good flavor
- Use the shaker bottle and season the pork butt. Pat the seasoning on as you go.
    - Nitrile gloves will help the seasoning stick to the pork butt and not your hands
    - You literally cannot over season this thing. It should look like you dropped the butt in the sand. That is the right amount of seasoning.

## The Smoke
- Get the smoker to 275&deg;F. Take your bake safe bowl and fill it with water. Stick it in the smoker out of the way
- Smoke the butt, fat side up. At this temp, it should take around 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours per pound. 
    - If you're using a thermometer, you'll want to put it about a quarter inch away from the bone and get as much surface area of the thermometer as possible. 
- I will <b>check</b> at 195&deg;F as the internal temperature. Here's the thing, it's done when it's done. You're looking for a split fat cap, and when you shake the butt it should look like a tower of jellow jiggling. I pull at 195&deg; because I like to have a bit more texture. If you're look for a buttery pork butt, 205&deg;F to 209&deg;F is good. Experimenting to your personal preference comes into play here. 
- When you're satisfied with the cook, pull it from the smoker. Use a towl to pull it out because you don't want to destroy the bark you've worked so hard to create. Just don't use tongs, please.
- Loosely wrap it in foil and let it rest for AT LEAST 30 minutes. Hour is prefered. 
- I can't stress the rest enough. You will have the driest meal and loads of disappointment if you skip the rest.
- Using bear claws or two forks, shred the pork
